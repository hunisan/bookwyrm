Bookwyrm

This application is used for keeping track of books.
First the user can add a book that he or she wants to read.
Later the state of this book can be modified multiple times:
when the user buys/acquires the book
when the user starts reading
when the user finishes reading 
optionally the user can track the current page where they are on while reading



Book:
title: (string) the title of the book 
genre: (string) genre of the book, e.g: mystery, sci-fi, romance etc.
page count: (integer) number of pages
